I got into IT because of an injury. I knew after I injured my knee I couldn't go back to where I was working. So during my time off I started to study IT and Python coding (which I need to get back too). I build my first PC and installed Windows on it, I then discovered VMs and so I started playing around with linux. The more I was learning the more fascinating I found it. I also found it was like walking down a path, the path starts in IT, but then forks off into many other paths. The path I found myself going down then was at a small computer and mobile repair shop, where I got to take apart many a PC and laptop along with many different types of mobile devices. As I was going down this path I came to another fork, do I continue down this route to try and improve my knowledge of repair, or go down another path. The other path that caught my eye was hacking, so I started down that path and once again I found it all fascinating. I enjoy puzzles and it seems like everything I do and learn was some type of puzzle. So fast forward to now. I continued down that path but came to another fork, where did I want to go Pentest, Blue team, etc. I decieded to go blue team since in my current job I have kind of assumed that role, but I still find it amazing being the shield that protects those that don't know any better. I try to educate people on the dangers of the internet at my work with weekly emails (which I still need to write). I hope this has given you a glimpse into my head, if you every wanna chat hit me up. You can check out my LinkTree, it has all my social on there. Thank you so much.
