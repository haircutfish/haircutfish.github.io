Here is the link to the Module: [A Scandal in Valdoria üåü](https://kc7cyber.com/challenges/132)

## Before you start

Before continuing with this write-up. If you haven‚Äôt already completed or checked out the write-ups on [Section 1](https://medium.com/@haircutfish/kc7-module-a-scandal-in-valdoria-section-1-kql-101-1f062c6f8a02) and [Section 2](https://haircutfish.com/posts/A-Scandal-in-Valdoria-Section-2-Welcome-to-Valdoria/). Please go back and do so. As the modules work best if you start at the beginning and work your way through. They help you to fully understand how to properly investigate and lay the ground work to be able to know what you are looking for. Also, as you go through each question, they can build off each other. Meaning an answer you get from one question, could be information you will use in another questions query. As in my prior write-up, I may not share all the questions in this write up, only the ones pretendant to the investigation. I will be including the answers to the questions though. But please know, while the answers may change, the way that you get them should remain the same.

### Take notes

As you proceed through the modules, it is imperative that you take notes of key information that you find. It is far easier to go through and grab the information you have saved, then to have to re-run queries to get it again. Additionally, in an investigation, it helps you to have that information on hand to be able to piece together what is happening. For me I am taking my notes in Notion, using a database to keep the key pieces of information accessible. But that may not be the way you do it, and that is ok. Take the notes the way that best suits you and your thinking.

## **Section 3: Plenty of Phish**

> You stop by The Valdorian Times office and meet with some staff. After the meeting, one employee, `Sonia Gose`, comes up to you and says she may have something that can help with your investigation.

## **What is Sonia‚Äôs job role?**

We know that _Sonia Gose_ is an employee, so we will start with the _Employee_ table. Since we have her name, we can pull results from the _name_ column using _where name == ‚ÄúSonia Gose‚Äù_. On the final line, since we want to know what her role is, we will us _distinct role_. This will only show us the result of her role. The query will look like it does below:
```
Employees  
| where name == "Sonia Gose"  
| distinct role
```
Once it is typed into the _Query Pane_, press the blue _Run_ button. The results will be found in the _Result Pane_ under the one and only column. Type or copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer into the _Answer Box_, and click _Submit_.

_ANSWER: Senior Editor_

----------

> `Sonia` shows you a suspicious email she received a few weeks ago.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*dTQeIPJdjEiKbpkV.png)

## **What email address was used to send this email?**

Reading through the email, we can see the email address at the top of the email. That email address is _newspaper_jobs@gmail.com_. But let us confirm this by querying the _Email_ table. We will want to look at the sender being _newspaper_jobs@gmail.com_ **and** the recipient being _sonia_gose@valdoriantimes.news._ The full query should look like it does below:
```
Email  
| where sender == "newspaper_jobs@gmail.com" and recipient == "sonia_gose@valdoriantimes.news"
```
Time to press the blue _Run_ button. Our results will be in the _Results Pane_, confirming that the email address of the sender is _newspaper_jobs@gmail.com_. Either type or copy and paste the answer into the _Answer Box_, then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*simCl86xuRM-H9Znc4_7PQ.png)

_ANSWER: newspaper_jobs@gmail.com_

----------

> Let‚Äôs look for this email in our email logs.

## **When was the email sent to Sonia Gose?** Enter the exact timestamp from the logs.

Heading back to the _Results Pane_, the first column is the timestamp. Click on the result, copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the timestamp into the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*jLq3qEL0uVjbs5No3uS0ng.png)

_ANSWER: 2024‚Äì01‚Äì05T09:42:05Z_

----------

## **What URL was included in the email?**

Again, we will head back to the _Result Pane_. This time scroll all the way over to the right. The last column is the _Link_ column, click in the result box (not on the link). Then copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the URL into the _Answer Box_. Then press _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*d2GsE1KC0f58PlgWtIlypg.png)

_ANSWER:_ [_https://promotionrecruit.com/published/Valdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx_](https://promotionrecruit.com/published/Valdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx)

----------

> You ask `Sonia` if she clicked on the link but she says she doesn't remember. Let's help her remember. üòê

## **What is Sonia Gose‚Äôs IP address?**

If you have taken notes along the investigation, you can pull the IP address from them. If not, lets get it from the database. We will have to start at the _Employee_ table. From there, we want to only pull the results for _Sonia Gose_. Which can be done with _where name == ‚ÄúSonia Gose‚Äù_. Then to finish the query, we only want the _IP Address_. We will use the _distinct_ operator to achieve this. The query should look like the following:
```
Employees  
| where name == "Sonia Gose"  
| distinct ip_addr
```
Press the blue _Run_ button. When the query finishes, you will have one result in the _Results Pane_. Click on it and copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer into the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*f2vPoZUtGn6fJner41WOLQ.png)

_ANSWER: 10.10.0.3_

----------

> Did Sonia click on this link?

## **If so, enter the timestamp when she clicked the link. If not, type ‚Äúno‚Äù.**

Time to dig into the logs. From the two previous questions, we have the IP address for Sonia and the URL from the potential phishing email. We will start by looking at the _OutBoundNetworkEvents_. Next up we will use the _where_ operator with the _src_ip_ column followed by the double equal ( == ) and Sonia‚Äôs IP address. Then in-between we will add _and,_ which means that the query will have to match both of the parameters we are specifying. Then the next column we will use is _url,_ again followed by the double equals ( == ) and the URL we got from the potential phishing email. The finished query should look like the following:
```
OutboundNetworkEvents  
| where src_ip == "10.10.0.3" and url == "https://promotionrecruit.com/published/Valdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx"
```
Click the blue _Run_ button. When finished, we have one result in the _Result Pane_. Meaning that Sonia did click on the link in the email. Click on the _timestamp_ result, then copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer into the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*tBOcqr9EnLpMRqPfnqQTJw.png)

_ANSWER: 2024‚Äì01‚Äì05T10:23:17Z_

----------

> Oh no! It looks like Sonia did click on the link! üò±

## **What was the name of the docx file in the link that** `**Sonia**` **clicked?**

Heading back to the _Results Pane_, click on the carat that is located on the left side of the result. It will drop down all the information located in the result. Look to the last entry, at the end of the _URL_ is the name of the file. Highlight and copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer into the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*9gVpbMMyrRiyMTOlllzuJQ.png)

_ANSWER:_ Valdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx

----------

> If she clicked on the link, we should assume that file might have been downloaded. Let‚Äôs see if we can find the file on her machine.

## **What is Sonia Gose‚Äôs hostname?**

Time to get a little complex! Unless you already have grabbed Sonia‚Äôs username we can make a more complex query that can pull it then using that information in another portion of our query. Using the _let_ operator, it will signify we want to create a variable. We will end the line with the variable name and an equal ( = ), I named mine _soniaUsername_. Now we will declare what is in the variable. We want to pull from the _Employees_ table. From that table, we want to look for _Sonia Gose._ Which will be achieved with _where name == ‚ÄúSonia Gose‚Äù_. On the next line, we will want to only show the username. This will be done by using the _distinct_ operator and the column name. Ending this line with a semi colon ( ; ), this will close the variable.

Now underneath the part of the last part of the variable, we will want to start with the _FileCreationEvents_ table. We already know the file name from our previous question. So we will look for the file name using _where filename == ‚ÄúValdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx‚Äù_. Now let‚Äôs add _and_, then include _username in (soniaUsername)_. This will look for results that have both the file name and the username that matches. The full query should look like the following:
```
let soniaUsername =@  
Employees  
| where name == "Sonia Gose"  
| distinct username;  
FileCreationEvents  
| where filename == "Valdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx" and username in (soniaUsername)
```
Click the blue _Run_ button. When the query finishes, we will have one result in the _Result Pane_. The second column is the _hostname_, click on it and copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer in the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*QVyeQlTWf0hNjXaTmr9ExQ.png)

_ANSWER: UL0M-MACHINE_

----------

## **When did the downloaded docx file first show up on Sonia‚Äôs machine?**

Heading back to the _Results Pane_, the timestamp was already included in our queries results. Click on the _timestamp column,_ then copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer in the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Xni_gBtxlhkhQc3sAOMiwg.png)

_ANSWER: 2024‚Äì01‚Äì05T10:24:04Z_

----------

## **What was the full path of the docx file that was downloaded to Sonia‚Äôs machine?**

Heading back to the _Results Pane_, the full path was already included in our queries results. Click on the _path column,_ then copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer in the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*kZU3XovIKRuwPMoxeQKOzw.png)

_ANSWER: C:\Users\sogose\Downloads\Valdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx_

----------

> A hash is a string that uniquely represents the contents of a file. We can get the hash of a file by running it through a hashing algorithm. Lucky for us, the hashes of all downloaded files are already captured.

## **What is the sha256 hash of the file that Sonia downloaded?**

Heading back to the _Results Pane_, the sha256 hash was already included in our queries results. Click on the _sha256 column,_ then copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer in the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*iTeeK4tdgR_rQ8p45HA9Lw.png)

_ANSWER: 60b854332e393a6a2f0015383969c3ac705126a6b7829b762057a3994967a61f_

----------

> After the malicious file was downloaded, it began executing malicious content ü™≤
>
> Let‚Äôs continue to look at Sonia‚Äôs machine.

## **What is the name of the file (.ps1) that was written to disk immediately after the docx was downloaded?**

We are going to re-use our previous query, but tweaking it a bit. On the final line of the query, we are going to remove _filename == ‚ÄúValdorian_Times_Editorial_Offer_Letter.docx‚Äù_. Replacing it with _timestamp between (datetime(2024‚Äì01‚Äì05T10:24:04Z) ..datetime(2024‚Äì01‚Äì05T10:25:04Z) )._ The reason we are using the above times is that we want to look directly after the file ran to see if anything suspicious was created. The query should look like the following:
```
let soniaUsername =  
Employees  
| where name == "Sonia Gose"  
| distinct username;  
FileCreationEvents  
| where timestamp between (datetime(2024-01-05T10:24:04Z) ..datetime(2024-01-05T10:25:04Z) ) and username in (soniaUsername)
```
Press the blue _Run_ button, there should be two results in the _Results Pane._ The first one being the original file we searched for. The next one is a _.ps1_ file. Click on the _filename_, then copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer into the _Answer Box_ and click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*N_5KzPtRDBBa9pre_shd7w.png)

_ANSWER: hacktivist_manifesto.ps1_

----------

## **When was this new file created?**

Heading back to the _Results Pane_, the timestamp was already included in our queries results. Click on the _timestamp column,_ then copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer in the _Answer Box_. Then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*Wrqk8plYfz59egab8DZMtA.png)

_ANSWER: 2024‚Äì01‚Äì05T10:24:32Z_

----------

> The file extension of this new file, ‚Äú.ps1‚Äù is pretty interesting.

## **Let‚Äôs do some research! What type of file is this?**

Heading over to our best friend Google, we do a search for _.ps1 file extension_. Google‚Äôs AI Overview gives us a great summary of what a _.ps1_ file is. Take the answer and type it into the _Answer Box_, and click Submit.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*GaEOm3uvmHQ63Bt0-RgPIA.png)

_ANSWER: PowerShell Script_

----------

> You manage to do some forensics and get a copy of the PowerShell script. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*OgFURGdhCNtsMfEy3cx8bA.png)

## **What does the attacker say to ‚Äúlet you know they are here‚Äù?**

Looking over the PowerShell script, we want to find the commented out ( # ) section that contains `let em know were here` . Underneath the above comment is the code snippet `Write-Host "lol ur bout 2 get pwnd..." -NoNewLine`. What this line of code does is output to the screen ( _Write-Host_ )`lol ur bout 2 get pwnd...` , then not create a new line after the out put is displayed ( _-NoNewLine_ ). The string of text in between the double quotes ( _‚Äú_ ) is the answer. Type the answer into the _Answer Box_, then press _Submit._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*i3TxoXuVKzJlLu5J74MrQw.png)

_ANSWER: lol ur bout 2 get pwnd‚Ä¶_

----------

## **According to the PowerShell script, what might be the hacker‚Äôs favorite color?**

Going back to the PowerShell script, we want to move down to the comment `green is hackr color`. This line gives away the answer to the question. You can type it into the _Answer_ _Box_ and click _Submit_. Taking a look at the code snippet underneath this comment, we see it is `$host.UI.RawUI.ForegroundColor = "Green"`. This line of code changes the text color in the terminal to green, the hacker‚Äôs favorite color.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*V5rerEOsI4-s7-k0iuDCCA.png)

_ANSWER: green_

----------

## **The purpose of the script is to invoke ____ and uncover da truth**

The first comment in the PowerShell script gives us the answer. Type the answer into the _Answer Box_, then click _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*scNJbo8Bg0woZyaaNvAmdQ.png)

_ANSWER: Plink_

----------

Here is a run through of what each part of the _hackvist_manifesto.ps1:_

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*WHVxr6t4qm89P1W8zYcdGA.png)

----------

> We might be able to find more information about the PowerShell script in **ProcessEvents** data.
>
> Look for process events related to the PowerShell script. Use the name of the .ps1 file (hacktivist_manifesto.ps1) to find related ProcessEvents.

## **How many Process Events are there related to this PowerShell script on Sonia‚Äôs machine?**

It took me a bit to figure out the proper query for this question. I also looked at the hint given by KC7. That hint being, _look in process_commandline_. I bring this up as my original thought was to look only at the process name, which doesn‚Äôt give all the process events related to the PowerShell Script. With that said let‚Äôs get into the query used to answer the question.

We are going to keep the variable we created during the previous query. Starting after the variable, we will be using the _ProcessEvents_ table. We will look want to look at the _procees_commandline_ to see if it contains _hacktivist_manifesto.ps1_. Along with Sonia‚Äôs username, which can be achieved with _and username in (soniaUsername)_. On the final line, we will use the _count_ operator to count the results. The full query should look like the following:
```
let soniaUsername =  
Employees  
| where name == "Sonia Gose"  
| distinct username;  
ProcessEvents  
| where process_commandline contains "hacktivist_manifesto.ps1" and username in (soniaUsername)  
| count
```
Press the blue _Run_ button or press _shift enter_ together as this will run the query as well. Once it completes, you will get one result in the _Result Pane_. Then type the answer into the _Answer Box_, and press _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*UptLhgmt1sg9nodAlzVCPw.png)

_ANSWER: 3_

----------

> It looks like one of the processes is using schtasks.exe, which creates [scheduled tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/schtasks). Scheduled tasks can be used to conduct certain actions at a regular interval.

## **What is the full command used to create the scheduled task?**

We need to start by removing the _count_ operator from our previous query. Once you do, _Run_ the query again. We will have some great information to go through now. Before we go through that information, if you haven‚Äôt, take a peek at the link that KC7 provide on Scheduled Tasks. It will give insight into what we need to look for on this task.

Taking a look over the results in the _Results Pane_, we want to find _schtasks_. This is alias for the _schtasks.exe_ tool. In the second result, we can see _schtasks_. Click on this result, and copy ( _ctrl c_ ), then paste the answer into the _Answer Box_ and click _Submit._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*8vOfjI1XDPiicqNeZp3UqA.png)

_ANSWER: schtasks /create /sc hourly /mo 5 /tn ‚ÄúHacktivist Manifesto‚Äù /tr ‚Äúpowershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ProgramData\hacktivist_manifesto.ps1‚Äù_

----------

## What ExecutionPolicy is set in the command?

We need to take a look at the command that was included in the _schtasks_. In the _Results Pane_, you may need to extend the column to see the full command. You can also look at the third result, as this is the execution of what was created in the _schtasks_. The full command that is being executed is as follows: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ProgramData\hacktivist_manifesto.ps1` . As we can see the execution policy is set to _Bypass_, which means that it won‚Äôt be blocked and not warnings or prompts will be given to the user. Type the answer into the _Answer Box_ and press _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*wNjbUk1GFpBBAU3NysPA8g.png)

_ANSWER: Bypass_

----------

> Check ProcessEvents for evidence of `plink.exe` being executed on `Sonia's` machine.

## **What IP address is used when plink is executed?**

We are going to modify our previous query again. Jumping back down to _where_ under _ProcessEvents_. We will remove _hacktivist_manifesto.ps1_ from the query and replace it with _plink.exe_. The query should look like the following:
```
let soniaUsername =  
Employees  
| where name == "Sonia Gose"  
| distinct username;  
ProcessEvents  
| where process_commandline contains "plink.exe" and username in (soniaUsername)
```
Run the query by either pressing the blue _Run_ button or _shift enter._ When the query finishes, we are left with one results. Looking in the _process_commandline_ column, we can see the full command that was executed. At the end is the attackers IP address that the backdoor was connected too. Double Click on the command run, and it will drop-down the full Command. From here you can highlight the IP address and copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer into the _Answer Box._ Then press _Submit_.

_ANSWER: 136.130.190.181_

----------

> That‚Äôs not good. ü´¢ It looks like an attacker has established a connection to Sonia‚Äôs computer from an external IP address.

## **What username did the attacker use when connecting via plink?**

Heading back to the _Results Pane,_ we can see in the same command that the Attacker also supplied the _username_ that they are using. Once you‚Äôve seen it, highlight the _username_ and copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer into the _Answer Box._ Then press _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*aUF7w7UujbHrw6mxt9OJFQ.png)

_ANSWER: $had0w_

----------

## **What password did the attacker use when connecting via plink?**

Again, head back to the _Results Pane._ The _password_ is stored at cleartext within the command. Highlight the _password_ and copy ( _ctrl c_ ) and paste ( _ctrl v_ ) the answer into the _Answer Box._ Then press _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*83yo_DDmmXR_VoFhOwmFKw.png)

_ANSWER:_ thruthW!llS3tUfree

----------

> Attackers use plink to establish a tunnel to a compromised machine. Now that the attackers have established a tunnel to Sonia‚Äôs machine, they can manually run commands to do specific things on the device. This is called hands-on-keyboard activity.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*jMFarhXAMWCW6ygfVY9OGw.gif)

> Let‚Äôs look closer at this machine to find commands that the attackers may have run after establishing the tunnel.

## **What six-letter command did the attackers run to figure out which user they are logged on as on the computer?**

From our investigation so far, we have found that the attacker has connected to Sonia‚Äôs system. From our previous query, the attacker connected at _2024‚Äì01‚Äì06 02:39:35_ and the parent process was _cmd.exe_. With that knowledge, lets change our query up a bit and see if the attacker ran any other commands. We will keep the entire query the same, except for the final line. We will start the line off with _where username in (soniaUsername)_ _and._ From here we will add the timestamp of the execution of the _plink.exe_ executable, and see if any commands were run till the end of the day. This part of the query should look like the following, _timestamp between (datetime(2024‚Äì01‚Äì06T02:39:35Z) .. datetime(2024‚Äì01‚Äì07T00:00:00Z) ) and_. We will end the line with _parent_process_name == ‚Äúcmd.exe‚Äù_. Since we know that the parent process from the execution of _plink.exe_ was _cmd.exe_. With our query complete it should look like it does below:
```
let soniaUsername =  
Employees  
| where name == "Sonia Gose"  
| distinct username;  
ProcessEvents  
| where username in (soniaUsername) and timestamp between (datetime(2024-01-06T02:39:35Z) .. datetime(2024-01-07T00:00:00Z) ) and parent_process_name == "cmd.exe"
```
Press the blue _Run_ button or press _shift enter_ together to run the query. Time to look in the _Results Pane_. As we can see several commands were run by the attacker. The first command the attacker ran was _whoami_, which is used to identify which user you are signed in as on a system. This command equals up to six letters as well, making this our answer. Type it into the _Answer Box_ and press _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*s-wogRv70_kMEgNbv18QOA.png)

_ANSWER: whoami_

----------

> Nice! `whoami` is a called a discovery command. Attackers use commands like these to learn more about the computers they compromise.

## **How many discovery commands did the attackers run on this machine?**

Heading back to the _Results Pane_, we want to look at the other commands the attacker ran on the system. We already discussed what _whoami_ is and what it does. But what about the other commands?

-   _ipconfig‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_will display the network configuration for the system.
-   _arp -a‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_will display the Ip Addresses of the systems it knows about on the local network. Along with their MAC (Media Access Control) Address.
-   _tasklist /svc_‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädisplays a table of all the current running process, along with the associated services.
-   _netview_‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcan be use it to gather information about the network‚Äôs structure, connected devices, and accessible shares.

From all the descriptions above, you can see how an attacker can use these commands to discovery vital information about a targets system. Then use that information to pivot and escalate there privileges or move laterally through a system. All that being said, count the number of these commands. Then type the answer into the _Answer Box_, and press _Submit_.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*upfEBFBV36Ag-Gnu4iUjsw.png)

_ANSWER: 5_

----------

> We‚Äôve hit a dead end! You triaged the rest of the logs for this machine and it looks like nothing else malicious happened here.
>
> Maybe the attackers weren‚Äôt interested in Sonia‚Ä¶

## **Do you think we can safely stop our investigation here? (yes/no)**

The quick and easy answer is **NO**!!!!!! The reason being is that we have clear evidence that Sonia‚Äôs system was compromised. With the gathered information so far, we will need to query other systems in the network to see if any malicious activity is present. What most likely has occurred is the attacker has gained access to Sonia‚Äôs email, to which they will send the same malicious file to others in the network. Thus compromising their PCs, until the attacker has gain access or the information they were looking for.

## Timeline so far
